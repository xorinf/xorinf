### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m [**Yashhwanth**](https://github.com/xorinf), a Full Stack Developer and AI Enthusiast based in Hyderabad, India.

I'm a B.Tech student who loves building things and exploring how they work. I don't have a fixed tech stack—I experiment with everything from web development to kernels (I use arch btw).

I’ve got some interesting projects, but my main focus right now is [CodeScribe](https://github.com/xorinf/CodeScribe).

If you want to collaborate or just chat, feel free to reach out via [Email](mailto:yashhwanthpayyavula@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/xorinf).

#### Fun Facts:

*   I like Coffee.
*   I am a night owl.
